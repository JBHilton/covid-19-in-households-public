    "# Out of household isolation for COVID-19\n",
    "### Joe Hilton, Thomas House, Heather Riley, Robert Sawko\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use an age- and household-structured model to assess the impact of out of household isolation (OOHI) as a mitigation measure against covid-19. We compare against a more typical within-household quarantine (WHQ) approach. Under OOHI, a single infected individual is removed from the household and has no interaction with the members of their own or any other household. Under within-household quarantining, the infected individual is still able to interact with the other members of their household but all of the members of that household generate a reduced contribution to the population-level outbreak.\n",

    "## Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a compartmental model with six compartments, **S**usceptible, **E**xposed, **P**rodromal/presymptomatic infection, symptomatic/fully transmissible **I**nfection, **R**ecovered, and **Q**uarantined/isolated, which we will call the SEPIRQ model. The same structure is used under both external and internal quarantining, but the role of the **Q** compartment depends on the quarantining method being used. The possible transitions are infection of a susceptible (**S** to **E**), progression from exposure into the prodromal phase (**E** to **P**), progression from prodrome into full infection (**P** to **I**), recovery of an infectious cases (**I** to **R**), quarantining of infected cases (**E**, **P**, and **I** to **Q**), and recovery of a quarantined case (**Q** to **R**). The population is further subdivided into three age- and vulnerability-stratified classes: children, non-vulnerable adults, and vulnerable adults. Our model works at the level of a single household, which is specified by the number of individuals of each class in the household. These numbers are static, but the members of each class may move between epidemic compartments. The instantaneous state of a household can be summarised as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(S_C,E_C,P_C,I_C,R_C,Q_C,S_A,E_A,P_A,I_A,R_A,Q_A,S_V,E_V,P_V,I_V,R_V,Q_V).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The dynamics within each household are captured by a Markov chain whose evolution is captured by a set of Kolmogorov equations. The equations corresponding to households in different compositions can be combined into a block-diagonal system, with the proportion of households in a given composition equal to the total probability in the corresponding block. Because infection can transmit between households, we add a nonlinear term to the Kolmogorov equations capturing household-to-household transmission which couples the otherwise independent blocks of the system. The result is a system of ODEs which capture the proportions of households in each composition and epidemiological state as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell we introduce the disease parameters for our model. The three \"progression\" events (**E** to **P**, **P** to **I**, and **I** to **R**) take place at fixed per-capita rates $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$, and $\\gamma$. Here we choose rates of 1/1, 1/5, 1/4, i.e. each case experiences on average a short incubation period of one day, four days of prodromal infection and five days of full/symptomatic infection before recovering. Infection occurs along three different routes: internal transmission between members of the same household, external transmission between members of different households, and imports of infection from outside of the population. Both prodromal and symptomatic individuals transmit, with the infectiousness of prodromal individuals scaled by an age-specific factor $\\tau$. The intensity of between-household transmission is scaled down by a factor $\\epsilon$, capturing the idea that interactions outside the household are likely to involve less intensive contact than those within the household; since this is the only interaction between households, $\\epsilon$ defines the level of coupling between the different household sub-systems. The transmission is age-structured through the use of age-structured contact matrices $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{home}}$ and $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ and an age-specific susceptibility vector $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ (`sus` in the cell below). To obtain age-structured transmission matrices for within- and between-household transmission we scale the rows of the two contact matrices by the elements of $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ and then mutliply both (with the external mixing term scaled by $\\epsilon$) by a scaling factor chosen such that the eigenvalue of the sum of the two transmission matrices is equal to a specified basic reproductive ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are specified in a dictionary in the next block. The contact matrices are taken from estimates generated by Prem et. al. (2017). Because we will be using different age boundaries to them, we need to aggregate their estimated matrices, which requires an estimate of the sizes of each age class in their division, which we take from the file `United Kingom-2019.csv` (available from https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-kingdom/2019/). We also need to then split the adults into vulnerable and nonvulnerable individuals - to do this we need the population-level proportion of individuals who are vulnerable, which we estimate to be approximately 2.2/56 based on ONS data on the number of people shielding in England (available at https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronavirusandshieldingofclinicallyextremelyvulnerablepeopleinengland)."

    "## Introducing isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below we convert the specifications from the dictionary into input for our model and add some extra parameters which define the quarantining strategy we wish to model. The rate at which an infected individual is quarantined depends on how far the infection has progressed; isolation should happen faster as the infection progresses because more advanced cases should be easier to identify and simply because these cases will have had more time to be found through tracing. These rates are scaled by an adherence probability to capture the fact that many cases will not be identified and not all individuals who are asked to isolate will do so. We define a discharge rate of 14 days, which should be long enough for individuals to be recovered when they return home or cease isolating. The parameter `model_input.adult_bd` defines the boundary between children and adults in the list of age classes (using zero-indexing). In our simple two-age-class-plus-vulnerable-adults framework this is just 1, but for flexibility we keep it a user-defined parameter. Specifying this boundary is necessary because when implementing external isolation we do not allow adults to isolate if it means leaving children alone without any adults. The Boolean array `model_input.class_is_isolating` summarises the answers to the question \"if a person of class $j$ is present in the household, should a case of class $i$ isolate?\". For external isolation, we are interested in isolating adults who live with vulnerable adults, so the $(2,3)$rd and $(3,3)$rd entries of the matrix is `True`, and everything else is false. The last parameter, `model_input.iso_method`, is set to 0 if we are modelling external isolation and 1 if we are modelling internal isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by modelling OOHI. Under this control strategy, when an individual enters the quarantine compartment they make no contribution to within- or between-household infectious pressures. Because we model within-household mixing as frequency dependent, the rate of infection within households includes a factor of $1/(S+E+P+I+R)$ which does *not* include the quarantined individuals. When externally quarantined individuals are discharged they join the recovered compartment and behave identically to the other members of this compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal isolation is slightly more complex. When an individual is quarantined, they remain in the household (in particular, the household size remains $(S+E+P+I+R+Q)$) and continue to transmit infection to other members of their household. We scale their infectiousness relative to cases in the **I** compartment by a factor $(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_2}\\tau + \\frac{1}{\\gamma})/(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_1} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_2} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma})$. This slightly unwieldy expression averages over the possible relative infectiousness of this quarantined case - zero if exposed, $\\tau$ if prodromal, one if fully infectious. The purpose of internal isolation is to reduce household-to-household transmission, which we account for by scaling the contribution of all households containing one or more quarantined cases to population-level infectiousness by the factor `model_input.isoprob`."

The distribution of household sizes and age compositions is available from the ONS as datasets CT1088 and CT1089, and our assignment of vulnerable adults to households is based on the ONS data on shielding individuals (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronavirusandshieldingofclinicallyextremelyvulnerablepeopleinengland). We combine this information with our model input to create a household population object.

We specify the rates of importation for prodromal and fully symptomatic infections separately, emphasising that the requisite scaling of prodromal infection by $\\tau$ takes place within the code so does not need to be applied here; we specify separate rates to account for the possibility that fully infectious cases may be less likely to travel than prodromal cases.\n",
