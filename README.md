# Compartmental household epidemiological models with age-structure

The models contained in this repository apply the concepts of [compartmental
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) to
a household. Additionally, the models can incorporate demographic information
in household composition which can be generalised such as age-structure. This
can be generalised into any type of risk-structure e.g. patient or staff and
shielded or non-shielded household member. The purpose of this software is to
enable quantitative evaluation of health policies in wide range of scenarios.

The repository contains a set of functions and classes as well several examples
analyses with heterogeneous risk-structure. Functions and classes automate the
construction of data-structures necessary to define household populations and
rate equations.
